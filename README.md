Pong Game

This is a classic Pong game implemented using Python and the Turtle graphics library. The game features two paddles, controlled by two players, that hit a ball back and forth between them. The objective of the game is to score points by hitting the ball past the opponent's paddle. The game ends when one player reaches a predetermined number of points or when the player chooses to quit.
